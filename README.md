# 🔄 Loopgate

A Golang-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that acts as a central broker to support Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows for AI agents.

## 📋 Overview

Loopgate serves as a communication bridge between AI agents and human operators, enabling seamless human oversight and intervention in automated workflows. The server facilitates real-time communication through Telegram, allowing multiple AI agents to request human input and receive approvals through a centralized system.

- **Receives** human confirmation requests or HITL checkpoints from AI agents
- **Routes** messages to the appropriate Telegram user or group based on unique client/session IDs
- **Awaits** human input, approval, or intervention
- **Responds** back to the requesting AI agent with the human decision
