**Build a Golang Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflows via Telegram**

Create a comprehensive MCP server that acts as a bridge between AI agents and humans through Telegram, enabling seamless two-way communication for approval workflows, confirmations, and human assistance requests.

## Core MCP Server Functionality

**MCP Protocol Implementation:**
- Implement standard MCP server protocol (JSON-RPC over stdio/HTTP)
- Expose MCP tools and resources that AI agents can discover and use
- Handle MCP client connections and maintain session state
- Support standard MCP capabilities negotiation

**MCP Tools to Expose:**
- `request_human_input` - Tool for agents to request human assistance
- `check_request_status` - Tool to poll for human response status
- `list_pending_requests` - Tool to view all pending HITL requests
- `cancel_request` - Tool to cancel pending requests
- `register_callback` - Tool to register webhook URLs for response notifications

## HITL Workflow Engine

**Request Management:**
- Accept HITL requests from AI agents via MCP protocol
- Generate unique request IDs and maintain request lifecycle
- Support different request types: confirmation, approval, input, choice selection
- Store request metadata: agent ID, client ID, priority, timeout, context

**Response Handling:**
- Capture and validate human responses from Telegram
- Match responses to pending requests using session management
- Support structured responses (yes/no, multiple choice, free text)
- Handle response timeouts and escalation

## Telegram Integration

**Bot API Implementation:**
- Poll Telegram Bot API for incoming messages
- Support both group chats and direct messages
- Implement message parsing and command recognition
- Handle Telegram-specific features (inline keyboards, callbacks)

**Message Routing:**
- Route requests to appropriate Telegram chats based on client configuration
- Support multiple clients with isolated chat channels
- Implement user authentication and authorization per client
- Handle message threading and context preservation

## Agent and Client Management

**Multi-tenancy Support:**
- Manage multiple AI agents with unique identifiers
- Support client isolation and access control
- Maintain agent-to-client-to-chat mappings
- Handle agent registration and deregistration

**Configuration Management:**
- Store client configurations (Telegram chat IDs, authorized users)
- Manage agent permissions and access levels
- Support dynamic configuration updates
- Handle multiple Telegram bots per deployment

## Communication Patterns

**Polling-Based (Primary):**
- Provide MCP tools for agents to poll request status
- Implement efficient polling with minimal latency
- Support long-polling for near real-time updates
- Handle concurrent polling from multiple agents

**Webhook-Based (Future Extension):**
- Design callback URL registration system
- Plan for HTTP webhook delivery to agents
- Support retry logic and delivery confirmation
- Implement webhook authentication and security

## Data Management

**In-Memory Storage (Current):**
- Use Go maps and structs for request/response storage
- Implement proper concurrency control with mutexes
- Design data structures for easy migration to persistent storage
- Handle memory cleanup and garbage collection

**Extensible Data Layer:**
- Abstract storage interface for future database integration
- Design schemas for requests, responses, clients, and configurations
- Plan for data persistence and recovery
- Support data export and import functionality

## System Architecture

**Modular Design:**
- Separate MCP protocol handling from business logic
- Abstract communication channels (Telegram, future Slack/email)
- Pluggable authentication and authorization systems
- Extensible request type system

**Concurrency and Performance:**
- Handle multiple concurrent MCP connections
- Implement efficient Telegram polling with goroutines
- Use channels for inter-component communication
- Design for horizontal scaling considerations

## API Specifications

**MCP Tool Schemas:**
```json
{
  "request_human_input": {
    "parameters": {
      "client_id": "string",
      "message": "string", 
      "request_type": "confirmation|input|choice",
      "timeout_seconds": "number",
      "callback_url": "string (optional)"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Requirements:**
- Telegram bot tokens per client
- Chat ID mappings for routing
- Agent authentication tokens
- Request timeout configurations
- Rate limiting parameters

## Future Extensibility

**Multi-Channel Support:**
- Design interfaces for Slack, WhatsApp, email integration
- Abstract message formatting and parsing
- Support channel-specific features and limitations
- Implement unified response handling

**Advanced HITL Features:**
- File upload and sharing capabilities
- Rich media support (images, documents)
- Workflow state machines for complex approvals
- Integration with external approval systems
- Audit logging and compliance features

**Deployment Considerations:**
- Docker containerization
- Environment-based configuration
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints
- Graceful shutdown and restart handling
- Load balancing and high availability

Build this as a production-ready MCP server that AI agents can register and use for reliable human-in-the-loop workflows, with clear separation of concerns and extensible architecture for future enhancements.
